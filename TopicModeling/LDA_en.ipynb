       " 'The appeal of Dark souls is built on two pillars. Fighting and environmental exploration. It\\'s essentially a fighting game  set in a hopeless black fantasy setting where the story gets unveiled to you by your own exploration of items and environment. Returning to the aforementioned dual pillars this game is built on, this is the crux of the game\\'s appeal: if you like tough combat and feel a sense of reward when overcoming tough (and at times unfair) foe AND you like environmental story telling set in a \"everything in the world is fucked beyond salvation\" theme, then this game will appeal to you and you will love it. If the above do not sound appealing to you then do not bother with this game. The creator of this game is a self-proclaimed masochist and you will realise it playing the game! \\n\\n\\nEvery time I defeated an enemy I never felt a sense of accomplishment, and generally as much as I like dark fantasy, I like having some sense of salvation and redemption in my stories (I\\'m a huge berserk fan, the manga responsible for inspiring 90% the of from software games and even THAT has salvation and happy endings in it, which are completely absent in DS). So for me I never wanted to stay in the world of dark souls, because it\\'s miserable and fucked beyond repair.  I prefer games that have dark AND light themes in their story telling eg the witcher, red dead redemption. \\n\\nCombat: is all about dying and learning with irritation-infused patience all the way. You will die a lot, and you need to be patient in order to slowly get better and overcome a foe. For me this was ultimately pointless. I like learning a game if the game motivates me with a reward. Dark soul\\'s motivation is based on the premise you feel a sense of accomplishment when overcoming an enemy. I never did. Other traditional RPGs work with me because they have more appealing storylines\\' so every road-block enemy I fought held the motivation that I would advance to the next part of the story. Considering everything in the world of dark souls is ruined beyond repair, no one can be saved and both endings are bleak and miserable....what\\'s my motivation? If you like hard challenges for the sake of it, ignore my criticisms, if you want a happy ending at the end of your gruelling journey, avoid this game. \\n\\nMusic: A bit generic at times, but honestly is the only flawless thing about this game. \\n\\nconclusion: Respect to this game\\'s level design, and for being different from its competitors when it came out. But be aware of what you are getting into, play a demo or a mate\\'s copy before spending money on this game. It has clout in the industry, but it\\'s only appealing to minority of challenge junkies, and you\\'ll see why if you play this game. I occasionally replay this game because I wonder \"am I wrong? Is there something I missed about this game?.\" After playing for about an hour or two I remember why I gave up on this game and on from software games overall.  Witcher 3 is far superior.',\n",

       " 'I make this review as an extremely experienced veteran to the Soul series. I have PvP\\'d & beat all Fromsoft games after Demon\\'s Souls multiple times.\\n\\nThis is a semi-old game cult classic that even got labeled the overrated & made up: \"Ultimate Game of All Time\" award at the \"Golden Joystick Awards\" but in reality those people that nominated & voted it as \"best game of all time\" clearly did not replay it. Well let me tell you that in many ways it doesn\\'t hold up, the game has a lot of flaws & it becomes unfun due to them, this game aged notably poorly, might even be the worst game in the Souls series objectively I say this as somebody that has played them all multiple times even Demon\\'s Souls.\\n\\nStarting on a positive note: The only Unique aspect of Dark Souls 1 is it\\'s armor system, which is the best in the series this is the game that did poise the most correct way. Armor does feel like armor, it\\'s heavy, it makes you not flinch on light hits, it\\'s arguably even recommended in the late game at least for someone new to the game that is ignorant to boss attack patters. In every other department it has already been outclassed by the other Souls games, especially in it\\'s world building while Dark Souls 1 has good levels such as Undead Burg/Parish, Duke Archives, Sens Fortress, DLC: Oolacile Township & the Catacombs BUT It has brutally bad ones mainly due to how incredibly EMPTY they are, which make the game feel like a running simulator: Darkroot Garden, Anor Londo (early on), Ash Lake, Blighttown where you spend doing nothing in the game other than holding B and the Stick forward in your controller. As a novice sience you will probably die to a lot of early game bosses which is undestandable part of the punishment will be this unfun aspect of the game where you will just be sprinting back to a boss over & over on an empty space here you will notice why this simply is a game that does not hold up, a complete game must have content not feel like a beta.\\n\\nAnyhow. The challenge is definetly there for a newcomer if you are \"prepared to die\", but is it fun? especially with all the options that exist now? I wouldn\\'t say so. Pick up any other Souls game & I promise you will have more fun & more content. Replaying this one last time convinced me this is the worst in the series lol to any veteran fanboy of the game I\\'d recommed you to replay it so you see what I saw.\\n\\nGeneral pro tips for new players:\\nStart as Bandit (pure physical focus class), pick up the Master Key as starting gift (this allows you to skip some boring parts of the game or at least have that as an option), the poise stat is the ability metal armors give you to not flinch against a hit the higher it is the heavier hits you will be able to take, do not ever level resistance, you should get the minimum status requirements to wield a weapon you like early then focus on general survival/gameplay stats like Vigor & Endurance which are stats you should always have higher than your offensive stats early on if you are new.',\n",

Which results in you occasionally killing friendly NPCs by accident. Which you can\\'t undo without replaying the whole game up to that moment, because This. Is. DarkSouls.\\n\\n- In end effect, you get to find out about half of the keyboard/mouse controls by watching youtube and then googling \"how to X in Dark Souls prepare to die\". The last bit is important because they changed the controls for Remastered (THANK BOB). (But then, in the Remastered, you actually just get the correct hints and a keyboard mapping menu in-game, like you should.)\\n\\n- camera control with the mouse is horribly jerky, especially with wall avoidance turned on (default, can only be turned off while playing, not on title screen. Per save?)\\n\\n- The jerkiness apparently extends to keyboard and mouse timings? I could not, for the life of me, reliably parry in this version. I parry more by accident in Remastered (different keys) than I ever managed to do it on purpose after hours of trying in Prepare To Die.\\n\\n- if you read up on-line, people recommend just installing DSfix right away because they consider the unfixed version borderline unplayable due to the above.\\n\\n- Last but not least, I have not managed to find a way to skip the cut scenes on the keyboard and mouse. And they are LONG, so I had a lot of time to try. (Yep, longer than the horse cart scenes from at least two other games...)\\n\\nI understand you got to be a little masochistic to play Dark Souls titles, but with this PC port it is not the good kind of masochism.\\n\\nAnd I say this, as someone who broke down and bought the Remastered Edition after trying this burning Undead heap here for two days, and has been enjoying playing Remastered so far.',\n",

Not the poison water, I actually think that's fine (though the Rusted Ring shoudl have been in Blighttown and NOT the Undead Asylum.) But the mosquitos were annoying since it's hard to actually HIT them, even when they're right next to you, because of their weird hitbox and how they jerk the camera around. Quelaag was a nice difficulty spike on a fair boss.\\n\\nSen's Fortress was fun, the bonfire placement was awful though, particularly with how needed it was. Iron Golem was another tough but fair fight.\\n\\nAnor Londo was gorgeous and I enjoyed it a lot, the giants and demons had simple but engaging attack patterns that I felt frustrated with, but again, I KNEW it was MY fault.\\n\\nOrnstein and Smough was SUCH A RUSH!!! I wasn't doing any damage, so I left, upgraded my gear a bit, then came back. I killed Smough first, and Super Ornstein is definitely going to rank up with my favorite bosses for a while.\\n\\nAfter the Lordvessel things were still fun, but they started to go downhill.\\n\\nSif was fun, no complaints there.\\n\\nNew Londo ruins was... pretty underwhelming honestly, to the point of forgetability. Four Kings was unexpectedly fun though!\\n\\nThe Catacombs (which I did before Lordvessel) were ok, Tomb of Giants was again, underwhelming, and the darkness mechanic just felt cheap, not like it added anything.\\n\\nDukes Archives and Crystal Cave were both interesting, the level design had more spark in it.\\n\\nI did the run-ups to both Nito and Seath before leaving to go do Lost Izalith first.\\n\\nAnd... wow. It just felt unfinished. And then Bed of Chaos was just... absolutely terrible. Easily the worst Souls boss I've ever fought, and probably the worst boss EVER. Terrible hitboxes, cheap mechanics, absolutely awful in every way.\\n\\nAriamis was underwhelming (though having the option to just not kill Priscilla was an unexpected level of player choice).\\nThe DLC was ok, meh areas with fun bosses, definitely felt too short, and the Oolicile Sorceresses in the Abyss were just BS.\\n\\nSanctuary Guardian got my blood pumping, Artorias was AWESOME, and Manus kicked my ass but was so much fun.\\n\\nOther big, glaring issues:\\n\\nThe camera is hot garbage, particularly in tunnels, where it just has a seizure. It will whip around constantly, frequently causing you to roll off a ledge and die for no reason.\\n\\nThe collision for the models is wonky, so in a LOT of places you'll just be walking normally and then slide off of what looks like perfectly walkable land to your death. This is particularly egregious when you have to try and jump to get somewhere, or you think you can drop down onto a ledge (like in the Great Hollow) and then you just slide off of a perfectly flat surface like it's made of greasepaper.\\n\\nMob drops are tied to the body of the mob if it doesn't disintegrate, so a lot of the time the ragdolling corpse can fling off the edge along with your loot.\\n\\nThe game feels good until you get the lordvessel, and then proceeds to get more progressively BS and cheap the farther you go; I feel that the game's age is definitely showing.\\n\\nI cannot recommend this, and from what I've read and seen, the remaster is almost exactly the same game, so I can't recommend it either. The kicker is no online, that's a fundamental part of the game that just isn't there, and hasn't been there for months and months. This is absolutely inexcusable (keep in mind that fans had long developed fixes to these issues) and would be reason enough for me to recommend giving this game a HARD pass on its own.\\n\\nI can personally recommend DS2 SotFS and Elden Ring; go try those instead, but only if you want a solely PvE experience sadly (apart from Elden Ring).

Yes the atmosphere is pretty good, and it does a good job at introducing rot and stagnation to what would have at once been a fantastic high fantasy kingdom. The game's lore is above average, but that's the problem. It's all lore and no story. Your character cannot choose any other goal that roaming the deceptively linear path because there's nothing better to do. By the time the game could even begin to say to have a plot, you're more than halfway through it.\\n\\nThere are moments where I think the designers smoked something. Some bonfires are placed great. Some aren't, and in a way that just flat out does not respect your time. There are moments where you're running for literal minutes and waiting on elevators for no good reason. I only died to Ornstein and Smough once, but after waiting for that stupid corkscrew elevator and running back was kind of a breaking point for me. It's like an unskippable cutscene that only keeps playing as long as you hold the forward button. The kicker is that a lot of the examples of this have enemies you can just run past, while the better placed bonfires have enemies you really need to fight to safely get past. It's a gat damn mystery.\\n\\nAnd lastly, just the sheer state of this port in particular. I believe this was 20 dollars at the time of purchase - and now you can only purchase the remaster which I'm lead to believe has its own problems. To put it bluntly, this edition is nigh unplayable without mods and one of the worst ports I've ever experienced. I'm more than willing to put modability as a plus, but when it's needed just to get the game to a playable state is when it's unjustifiable.\\n\\nI see the game get a lot of praise and it's not unwarranted.

There's a really cool mechanic a third into the game where if a frog breathes on you, you lose half your health until you solve a riddle (The riddle is you have to navigate through a zone that you're supposed to already know about with ghost enemies that go through walls and have an attack with a ridiculously long reach, you think maybe you can take them on slowly by luring them one at a time, but no, they don't hold agro on you so they just go back to hiding behind a wall. You are supposed to ignore them like every other enemy and find your way to the roof of the building that you can only reach by going up a ladder in the centre of the ghost riddle building, all with half health remember.) \\n\\nThe only reason people think this is fun is because after hours of brute force attempts on a boss people get a dopamine spike from finally taking them out. You can replicate this by not drinking water for a really long time and then having a really good quencher of a sip. \\n\\nThis game is just water and honestly I love water so maybe it actually is the best game ever \\n\\n10/10\",\n",

The terrible PC port combined with the level of know-how and precision expertise you have to wield simply to advance past the next 5 minutes of gameplay results in an excruciating experience for anyone who doesn't want to hold a gameplay guide on one hand while playing with the other. \\n\\nThe game is extraordinarily disrespectful of the player's time - punishing mistakes due to one extra button click, or a frame rate drop, or because you simply fail to correctly anticipate the hitbox of the next swing with what amounts to hours of retreading the same tedious ground again, and again, and again. The end result is that the act of trying to advance to anything rewarding in the game is excruciating. \\n\\nIt 'rewards' replay and experimentation by being utterly obtuse as to the mechanics or worth of most of its items, meaning that if you're not having someone else tell you how to do it, you might waste a useful item that would have game-long consequences for you, or you'll fail to go down certain paths or bring certain items to characters on the other side of the area that may help you get through the next boss. Of course, you couldn't have possibly known that those paths or item-character combinations would work unless you were willing to waste hours of your own time slogging back through the game for potentially no reward, or save scumming just in case, and I like to think you have enough going on in your life that you wouldn't see that as a deal worth making. So, I guess, Dark Souls doesn't reward experimentation. It punishes you for it by sucking the precious hours of your short life away for nothing...until someone tells you a better way to do things. \\n\\nMultiplayer connectivity is functionally broken on PC, so you'll never get the chance to team up with other players or receive in-game hints, meaning that a foundational mechanic of the game to enhance its enjoyment is gone. So now Dark Souls is simply a lonely, repetitive ramble around an ugly PS3 world as you beat your head against a brick wall again and again. Then you'll look up a walkthrough that will tell you 'this enemy is actually pretty easy to defeat if you know how'. Cool. Thanks for telling me. I'll be sure to go back an hour into the past and tell myself that the boss is easy to defeat, I just need to have defeated it to know that. \\n\\nThere are better versions of this game released after the fact that don't require you to finish this one in order to enjoy them.

       " 'Disclaimer: My steam \"time played\" hours are incorrect, I have just finished beating Ornstein and Smough, approximately 30 hours.\\n\\nUnfortunately I have to say that this game is mediocre at best. Combat is very buggy, it takes forever to kill things due to their massively oversized health bars which makes the game painfully annoying, and not in a \"oh this is difficult\" way, but a \"oh my god i just spent 5 minutes wailing on these 2 little easy skeletons to kill them and now I have to do that 10 more times before i reach a bonfire and repeat the process, this is so unbelievably boring\" kind of way. \\n\\nIf there is anything I can recommend you to do, it\\'s download a cheat trainer (i use FLiNG) and use it to give yourself infinite hp/one hit kill/speedhack whenever you die so you can get back to where you died quickly. The devs of this game are dumb enough to think that \"wasting the players time = difficulty\", so there\\'s a lot of points where that takes killing 10 little garbage easy guys for like 15 minutes to get back to the boss for another single attempt. Using cheats to \"create save points\" right before bosses (aka run back to where you were, in the same state that you were before starting the fight you died in) makes this game 25x as enjoyable.\\n\\nIt also might be more fun if they had more than ONE SINGLE ANIMATION for \"light attack\" and \"heavy attack\" on each weapon, and they actually added some sort of combos or something. Combat is incredibly one dimensional and feels like a quick-time version of 2007 Oldschool Runescape battles where you just stand there, press block/roll when they attack, and press attack immediately after blocking/rolling. That\\'s it. The combat is about as boring as melee combat can get. The game overall is very disappointing considering the amount of work that seems to have went into world building, balance and content. It could have been great, but unfortunately they skimped on the most important part of the game: the gameplay itself.\\n\\nOh and don\\'t even get me ****ing started about the hitboxes in this game in relation to their visuals. Ornstein and Smough were such a BS fight because of how bad the hitboxes were that it wasn\\'t even remotely fun. There were MANY, MANY times where I would perfectly dodge a specific attack in the same way I have the past 20 times and I would get hit, and then there would be times where I mistime my dodge and the attack directly hits me (visually and based on past experiences) but I get out without taking any damage or knockback. I know it is a game and there are always specific parts where you can dodge, as seen by speedruns, but you shouldn\\'t have to know how each NPC\\'s attack is coded to be able to dodge them, you should be able to look at the visual and dodge them.\\n\\n\\nOverall I would recommend playing God of War on the hardest difficulty instead if you\\'re looking for a game like this with better pacing, less time-wasting filler and a good, rewarding combat system. From what I have seen they have fixed a lot of these issues in Elden ring (mainly the having to spend 15 minutes getting back to the boss for each attempt) but I can not say for sure.\\n\\n\\nTLDR: Great game plagued by time-wasting filler and bugs/inconsistencies that make it very frustrating for all the wrong reasons. I enjoy working towards successfully completing a very difficult challenge like WoW mythic raids for example, but a lot of fights in this game seem more like you\\'re winning because the bosses attack hitboxes are being buggy and not hitting you properly when they should be, which is not satisfying to beat at all.',\n",

Have fun getting one-shotted by enemies with janky hit/hurtboxes, and map hazards that kill you because you were a pixel off with your jump. The game starts out [i]very[/i] fun, but rapidly becomes a numbing experience as you grind for souls while also trying to not be killed by hackers and exploiters. The usual toxic DS players say \"git gud\" or \"lol just turn off the online if you don\\'t wanna fight people,\" but that\\'s immensely disingenuous; a core part of the game\\'s experience is based on interacting with the other players in the world, both positively [i]and[/i] negatively, and to say \"just turn it off\" is truly asinine. However, if the game and community\\'s answer to such bad design is \"just ignore a huge part of the game,\" then I guess I don\\'t really need to play it.\\n\\nThis game has some serious overall design problems, and the controls feel slow. Grinding for souls isn\\'t fun, most bosses aren\\'t fun. The camera just sucks, and I was fighting it more than the monsters. It\\'s fine if people like this game for its atmosphere, unfair difficulty, and clunky controls, but I think there are prettier games out there with more reasonable difficulty spikes and much more fluid gameplay. The biggest problem with Dark Souls is that it likes to instantly kill you for fun, [i]I Wanna Be the Guy[/i]-style, and that is played out and boring. It was played out and boring before Dark Souls came out, too, but this game [i]thrives[/i] on it (and so does its community).\\n\\nIn the end, not for me.

       " 'I\\'m glad that I did finally beat this game, but even after putting in the hours this isn\\'t a game that I\\'d say that I enjoyed. The basic action & rpg fusion doesn\\'t really work for me: the numerical (rpg) and kinetic (action) parts of the game conflict with each other too often. For instance, at any given time you have a large number of varied weapons that you can use, and the different behaviors of these weapons really do affect how you\\'d use them in a fight. Unfortunately the capability to use a new weapon effectively is locked behind a heavy resource investment in both your character\\'s statistics and the weapon itself. On the other hand, the game\\'s split action/rpg nature aliases how well you\\'re playing with how well you\\'re supposed to be playing by not making it clear what is expected of the player. When I started fighting Ornstein and Smough with the weapon that I\\'d invested in up to that point I would have needed to hit just Ornstein 40 times in order to beat him and found the fight effectively impossible. When I switched to a different weapon that had better numbers and a longer reach to boot I found a more fair fight and Ornstein only took 10 hits to take down.\\nAdditionally, I don\\'t really think very highly of the action element of the gameplay. Defensive options (blocks, parries, dodges, and rolls) are extremely strong for both the player and the enemies while the offensive options are relatively weak, which leads to a slower paced game. Most of the time that I died outside of a boss fight it was because I was being impatient, which made me start to regard the game as a 90-hour marshmallow test. The skills that I picked up at the end of the game made me feel less like a swashbuckling sword fighter and more like a combat janitor: by the end I was beating enemies by exploiting the limitations of their programming, their inability to coordinate as a group, and their problems hitting targets standing on slopes slightly beneath them. I beat the final boss by standing in front of a pillar that he couldn\\'t figure out how to walk around. The combat system didn\\'t live up to the praise that people had lauded onto it.\\nI\\'m not writing this review to tell you that your favorite game is actually bad, or anything like that. If you love Dark Souls and the Souls games then I think that\\'s awesome, and that you should go on loving them.

       " 'Game #80\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t15.2.2020.\\n\\n[h1] A game that spawned a new genre [/h1]\\n\\nDark Souls, the first game, was, and still is revolutionary for its time. It’s a game that pretty much became its own genre and even though many games have tried to copy and paste it’s mechanics, none do it quite like the original game (or Demon Souls on PS3). \\n\\nDark Souls is a game that’s very difficult to start. Immediately, the game is very discouraging. It throws you into its world it explains nothing, it shows and teaches you almost nothing, the odds are against you and it, pretty much, expects you to fail. This is, surprisingly, a weird motivator that makes you keep playing the game. You want to beat the odds, you want to be the lowly nobody who will best the world and prove the game wrong. The odds may be against you but you can still beat them, you know it’s possible, it will just be a hard journey.\\n\\n[h1] Careful panning, taking it slowly and patience are your best weapons in Dark Souls [/h1]\\n\\nDark Souls is a third person action RPG, more or less. I say “more or less” because If you treat this game as all other action games, you are going to have a bad time. Dark Souls requires a certain state of mind to be played. In most action games you can mow down low level enemies with little effort and only get serious when you get to boss fights. Not in Dark Souls. In Dark Souls, every single enemy can kill you if you aren’t careful. The very first enemy you encounter can kill you with only a few hits. So what do you do? You play this game carefully. You plan you every attack, you roll around, you dodge and if you are feeling bold, you parry. You treat every single enemy as a threat and soon this becomes second nature to you. \\n\\n[h1] Your character can tire easily and you are expected to fight giant bosses [/h1]\\n\\nOne of the first things you will learn about Dark Souls is that you can’t just spam an attack. You can’t do this because you have a stamina bar. At first, this seems like a really annoying thing and, you know what, it kind of is but, this is also what gives this game its identity. The stamina bar depletes fast but it also recharges fast too. If you simply spam your attack, you will become tired and your character will become vulnerable. Don’t you think that you can just endlessly dodge and hold your shield forever too because that else depletes your stamina. The game encourages you to be careful but to also not get too comfortable with standing and using the same thing over and over again.\\nWhile small enemies (trash mobs) are a threat, the game wouldn’t be as popular if it weren’t for its bosses. The bosses in this game are big, strong, memorable and very intimidating. The first time you play a game you will probably say something like: “OH MY GOD! I HAVE TO FIGHT THAT THING!” with a shaky voice. Once you beat a boss, you will feel a sense of accomplishment unlike in any other game but you will die a lot.\\n\\n[h1] \"You died\" you will see this message a lot [/h1]\\n\\nDying is part of this game and actually a big part of the lore of Dark Souls. Every enemy you kill will award you with souls. Souls are basically your XP as well as your currency. Everything in this game requires souls. When you kill an enemy you get souls, kill bigger enemies and you will get more souls. Now, when you gather a lot of souls, you take them to a checkpoint (bonfire) and you spend them to level up your attributes. You can also use them to upgrade your weapons, buy equipment and consumables and for other various things. \\n\\nBEWARE, if you should die, you will lose all your souls BUT WAIT, it’s not all bad. You will only lose the souls that you haven’t spent and once you respawn, you can travel to the spot where you died are retrieve them. This is a really great mechanic. It encourages you to try again but also makes sure you don’t rush back to the place where you die so you don’t die on the way there. If you die before retrieving your souls from the last place you died, you will lose them for good. \\n[h1] The story is there but it\\'s entirely up to you how much of it you want to hear [/h1]\\n\\nSo, I haven’t mentioned the story. While there is indeed a story, the game simply doesn’t tell it to you. Or at least, doesn’t tell it directly. It gives you a brief explanation at the beginning and just throws you out there. You have to piece together the story by exploring the world, talking to characters, fighting bosses and generally you will get the gist of what was going on. If not, you aren’t really missing much. \\n\\nThe world of Dark Souls is amazing. It’s so carefully and lovingly tailored. The entire world is basically an abandoned kingdom populated by undead minions and beasts. Going from checkpoint to checkpoint can require quite a few attempts and once you reach it you might even throw a little celebration. For me, the absolute best feeling I ever got from playing Dark Souls was when I found a shortcut. As you explore the world, you will find ladders, elevators, bridges, locked doors. More often than not, once you open them, you will get a shortcut that will cut that 15 minute trip to a 1 minute climb. Finding shortcuts makes me happier than it should.\\n\\n[h1] You aren\\'t alone... [/h1]\\n\\nI haven’t even mentioned the online. While you don’t have to play the game online at all, you will be missing out on what makes Dark Souls special. Dark souls has this thing called “humanity”. If you consume a “humanity” you turn into a human. This makes it easier for you to find rare items and material easier BUT it also puts a target on your head. Other players who are also playing their game can invade your game in an attempt to kill you. So if you plan on using humanity, make sure you are prepared for a fight against an over-powered invader.  \\n\\nTruly, Dark Souls is a masterpiece. My review cannot do justice to how great this game and SERIES is.\\n\\n[h1] BUT BUT BUT [/h1]\\n\\nNot this version. Definitely not this version. This PC version of the original Dark Souls is the laziest console port in existence. You know how many PC games recommend you use a controller, well not only does this version recommend it, it spits in your face if you want to use a mouse and keyboard. It doesn’t even show you the keyboard keys but the layout of an Xbox 360 controller. I can’t even begin to describe how insulting this is. I like my Xbox 360 controller and I will gladly use it with this game but not everyone who owns a PC wants that. The game is locked at 30 frames per second, and you will be lucky if you can even get that to run smoothly. The online community is full of hackers that can’t be damaged and the graphics look like crap. Overall, it’s almost unplayable. \\n\\n[h1] I shouldn\\'t have to patch a game in order to make it playable [/h1]\\n\\nYES, you can patch the game up with lots of patches and make it a bit more playable but that’s not a good excuse to buy this game. IN FACT, you can’t even buy this game anymore. This version isn’t available anymore, only the remastered version. I’m not sure if the remastered version is better than this one.\\n\\nSo, if nobody can even buy this game anymore why did I bother even writing this review? Because I adore this game and I feel it deserves a review. If you want to play Dark Souls, get the remastered version or the console versions of this game. Just play it, but not this one, at least not if you aren’t keen on installing a thousand patches.\\n\\nNext game: The Darkness 2\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075061111/recommended/67370/\\n\\n[h3]If you liked my review, feel free to follow my curator group.

There\\'s no in-game manual and any tutorial you get as you progress, shows you controller key bindings. It\\'s laziness combined with arrogance BUT, as I said, it can be overcome. I got myself a decent Xbox 360 controller and was well underway.\\n\\n[h1]Atmosphere[/h1]\\nThe first good impressions were delivered by the gloomy hostile world, that you\\'re thrown into. Creeping through the sombre halls of the Undead Asylum really gave the sensation of loneliness, danger and longing for some kind of redemption. Dark Souls world is the kind that leaves you alone with your demons.\\n\\n[h1]Game design[/h1]\\nInstead of giving the players what they expect from an RPG, Dark Souls redefines the building blocks that make up a game, so that when they put it together, it\\'s a one of a kind experience. They\\'ve given their own answers to some major questions, that every game developer faces. Questions like \"what is dying in a video game and how to handle it without breaking the immersion\". Questions like \"what really is saving a video game progress and what can be done with it to make it part of the actual gameplay, not something you do between starting and quitting the game\". Underneath an RPG skin, there actually hides a grinder with fantastic replayability value and hence makes for a great speedrunner. A veteran Dark Souls player becomes a Dark Souls speedrunner.\\nOn the downside the game miserably fails to explain crucial elements of the game like all the different stats in the menu that come with no explanation within the game. The multiple definitions of the word \"S/soul\" speaks of poor imagination. The menu design is miserable at best and much of the armour and weapons left me unimpressed. For the better part of the game I was also afraid to use the loot I gathered, because I struggled with figuring out how rare or common something was.\\n\\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\\nOne of the most puzzling aspects of the Dark Souls experience was the unsatisfied curiosity of knowing what I was doing. What is this place? Hell? Afterlife? Some kind of otherworldly dimension? There were undead, this means they were people at some point in the past, right? Did actual people live in New Londo before it was destroyed or was it occupied by undead? Why did they turn into ghosts? Why am I undead? I was tangled in a maze of questions and felt that my questions rang in deaf ears.\\n\\n[h1]This I disliked the most...[/h1]\\nUnder the hood this game is a grindfest. The point is to kill you as fast as possible, without leaving the luxury of plentiful save points. The big idea is not to let you progress in the game but to make you master every part of it with experience and patience like a damn circus monkey.\\n\\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\\nI tried to figure for days whether I\\'d give it a positive or negative review because I can see all the good the developers have done here, but what it boiled down to is the understanding, that I\\'ve buried the idea of ever playing Dark Souls 2 or Dark Souls 3.',\n",

With my beefy PC, I managed 14-25 fps. This can be fixed with a Nexus MOD called DSFIX (Which had to be fiddled with to optimise 60+ fps).\\n- The game is locked at 30 fps due to engine (This is fixed in Remastered and DSFIX).\\n- Game is unplayable without controller (MouseFIX from Nexus solves this).\\n- Firelink bugs and accidental NPC attacks, breaking them till you Redeem yourself, when tabbing in and out.

Enemy attacks hone in on you. Enemy attacks can go through objects, walls, etc, while your attacks cannot. Sometimes when dodging the game registers your last known direction of movement for dodging instead of using the current direction that your analog stick is being pushed towards. I played this game when I was young, and I thought the world was cool and well crafted and the fights were fair, even tho I never even rang the 2nd bell. Alas, I am now fully grown, and this game has definitely lost its charm. Especially once I reached Blight Town and Anor Londo. Two terrible areas back to back. And what has possibly stopped me from playing further is the Ornstein and Smough fight, since it is bullshitamus to the maximus.\\nBeating Ornstein and Smough left me feeling, ironically, hollow, since the fight is poorly designed and my victory felt unearned from a lack of genuine challenge or balancing. \\n\"The difficulty of this fight comes more from phase 1 and how much of a poorly designed trash heap it is.\\nAs a dual boss the fight is naturally already mediocre, but this one has a peculiar shittiness to it with all the dumb things that can occur and safe openings barely existing since Smough is typically wedged inside Ornstein\\'s ass for about 90% of the fight. It\\'s somewhat rare to have them be separated. Some of the stupid shit that can happen is Smough using his shovel attack and going over the pillars (basically making them useless to hide behind at times), Smough\\'s hammer collision pushing Ornstein back/forward which can make for some bullshit situations, and Ornstein\\'s charge being a glitchy hard to read piece of crap\" -G-S0ul.\\nI think G-S0ul hits the nail on the head with this poorly designed garbage.

It is mostly due to armies of fanboys who won't admit that there are some flaws with the game and that their precious little gem might be flawed. Yet, here I'm to shed some light on older games for anyone wishing to jump in late.\\n\\n\\nFirst of all, interface and controls are just terrible even playing with xbox controller. Movement not always registers like jumping attack and combat is just as much fighting your enemy as it is fighting your camera. It is clunky, character movements are imprecise and hitboxes are always iffy. I had found out that major cause of death in this game by far are bad controls and bad game engine. Sometimes enemies will auto land hit on you while performing jumping attack. They literally change their direction in the air to hit you while game arbitrary decide if your jump attack hits opponent or you just land awkwardly in the middle of the enemy pack. Then there is constant battling with camera and constantly making a wrong move. I swing heavy instead of jumping. It leaves open to counter attack and half of my hp is gone. Clumsy movement prevents me from positioning myself properly and I miss a hit. Not to mention that enemy can insta kill due to animation glitches where I died during the jump on the enemy. There was no animation from him which would count, but game had decided that I was hit. I find this game highly frustrating to play as the main source of challenge is dealing with quite frankly bad game. Consumables are non-rechargable through saves, but game insta kills you with no fair chance to prepare for further encounters? Game lags during certain moments? NPC have iffy AI who on rare occasions can aggro you while they should not? I have such experience with this game and it is just frustrating to get to where you actually need over such nonsense. Then there are weird bugs. Every reload game starts to lag as FPS drop severely. \\n\\nThen there is combat. I guess this is part of the charm to people. To keep trying and trying over again. Yet, I do not see enjoyment the same way. Difficulty spikes in this game are through the roof. You are fighting 20 minutes mobs only to get 1 chance at the boss which 2 shots you. There are no clues, no advise, nothing to help you with it. Boss appears, BAM, instant death. Then repeat for several hours boss grind before you get a routine and at that point, bosses become trivial too. In this sense, this game is amongst the easier ones as it is not demanding in terms of technical skill or game being difficult all the time. No, game is merely unreasonable and kills you outright. Then you learn how to dance and you overcome challenge quite easily. I never considered this kind of gaming to be enjoyable to me, but rather a method of abusing game mechanics which gives me very little pleasure. Dark Souls seem to be built around that gamey mechanic of abusing mobs and learning the game through trial and error. It also artificially stretches game time immensely as you must repeat lengthy portions of the game before you get chance to face boss itself which is just tedious and grindy. I personally cannot stand such grind and I strongly believe that before and after every boss there should be bonefires. Now, if I die, I have to repeat huge portion of a game just to get one chance at experiencing that those unique mobs are like. I tried to go under the bridge, yet, no bonefire, just some metal boar there. I had died to simple skeleton, because my hit went god knows where and it just went beserk with rapid succession of hits...\\n\\n\\nIn the end, I quit from frustration. I had found combat rather trivial as mobs could be dispatched with heavy attack quite easily. Bosses are gimmicky from few which I saw and quite easy when you know what to do (youtube is essential, but at the same time, it makes this game pointless). \\n\\nFor example, you are on a narrow bridge and your whole view is taken by boss back. I cannot see anything at all. Even if you know that to do, a lot of it is down to chance. Boss randomly blocks your path. Sometimes plunging attack doesn't work and your are dropped off the map. Game is damn buggy like that, I heard that boss itself can rather just fall off the edge. After beating said boss, I proceeded further. Game had no check point after a boss! Furthermore, it gave no warning about the dragon too. Not only that, it had level design where I could accidentally mistaken old bonefire with new and restart my whole progress! After that, dragon got bugged and it simply won't ignite the ground. I had to suicide myself just for him to do anything at all...\\n\\n\\nNow, game is also abysmal at explaining you things. Interface could not be worse. Not only it is clumsy to navigate through, but also it is full of stats which game does not explain at all. \\n\\n\\nThese are faults within game. It is not like game is bad. I certainly can see how people thirsty of such games at the time allowed Dark Souls to explode. Yet, I do not think that it really holds up to the modern standard. People here are promoting this game, because of nostalgia and due to their familiarity of the game. They already know everything and how game works. So, for them it is fine. For completely new player, I would hesitate to recommend this product. It requires certain kind of person to enjoy it. Long checkpoint, trivial combat designed to force grindy attempts against a boss. I would bet that sequel or Dark Souls - like games already innovated and improved on the concept as a whole and said game is rather for veterans. Unless of course unfair and grindy gameplay is attractive to you. A lot of people find enjoyment of spending a lot of time and effort in trying to learn sequence in how to engage mobs as engaging. For me, learning that this big boss can be defeated by B+B+RB sequence is little fun.\",\n",

       " \"Dark Souls is a deliberately clunky and frustrating fighting game. It is mostly linear aside from a few branches and tangents, so the player is usually provided with a clear sense of direction from the game's start to finish. The aesthetic of the game is very dark, gritty, and ugly; while this is sufficient to make an artistic point which is at the core of Dark Souls's appeal, the game's egregious length makes this a touch overbearing. The main issue with Dark Souls is how its un-intuitive, poorly organized stats and progression are so lazily thrown together so as to be nigh incoherent. Keeping track of which stats correspond to what on items is tedious and pointless, coupled with the arbitrary and frustrating of repairs and upgrades. All manner of mechanics like this make Dark Souls feel like a bad RPG not artfully difficult. Overall, Dark Souls presents an interesting artistic concept executed in a mediocre fashion.\",\n",
       " \"Got this game ages ago as part of a larger pack of games (maybe from Humble Bundle?), but hadn't installed it until now.\\n\\nThis game looks terrible and is impossible to control with a keyboard and mouse. I couldn't even figure out how to quit, because Escape wasn't bringing up any kind of menu. I couldn't even alt-tab or ctrl-alt-del! I was on the verge of just force-rebooting my computer to get out of it but decided to go through my keyboard buttons and the key to open the menu ended up being End, with PgUp and PgDn to select buttons on it. Never booting this up again.\",\n",
       " \"(Contains minor spoilers on the beginning of the game.)\\n\\nFirst off: (apart from the intro) - zero cut-scenes - Hurrah! We actually have true immersion! Oh to go back to the age of zero cut-scenes!!\\n\\nAfter 7 hours of play (-yes 7 HOURS) and finally killing the taurus demon at the Undead Burg I was constantly conflicted as to whether this would be a positive or a negative. Everytime I started to love the game, something round the corner would make me hate it and everytime I started to hate it, I would gradually warm to it again. The 30 fps was the first negative. This just shouldn't even be a thing. The fiddly controls and inconsistent mechanics regarding menu management was the next negative - this took me ages just to figure out. Then, as a console game, I made the decision to use my XBox controller rather than mouse+keyboard and this turned out to be fine. Working out the combos and moves actually got me back into liking it again.\\n\\nThen came the kick mechanic that it said you could do - which simply didn't work! Landing at those ruins after being carried by that giant crow and getting my arse kicked time and time again by those skeletons was no fun either. This meant  a YouTube visit and I realised it was best just to get myself to the Undead Burg. Finally I get myself to the first bonfire in the Undead Burg and I end up farming souls cos getting my arse handed to me on a plate 16 times without progressing aint much fun. Ploughing soul-points into strength, vitality, endurance and dexterity (like the guides say I should) didn't seem to make the slightest difference so it was  just about getting to that bleedin' taurus demon.\\n  \\nIn actual fact, I didn't mind the endless streams of death so much cos I did feel myself getting more and more proficient at the game and quite liked getting to know my way around and I knew I could eventually defeat the taurus demon sometime (albeit using a slight exploit - or cheese method as the youngsters say). So anyway, I finally kill the the taurus demon and I'm onto the next bit of the castle thoroughly expecting to see a bonfire to save all that hard earned (and I mean HARD EARNED) progress. What do I get? A huge dragon bombing from the skies and killing me outright in two fire-breathing attacks. And hey! I'm back at the Undead Burg again at that fricken bonfire having to do it... all ...over ...again! It's effectively throwing two bosses at me, one after another, WITHOUT a checkpoint! What!?  \\n\\nDo I want to go through that same process (that I've done for 5 hours already) only to get two-shot by a dragon? Do I want to go onto YouTube yet again to see how I defeat the dragon? NOooooooo. I just wanna ENJOY the game.\\n\\nSorry Dark Soul fans: the atmosphere of the game is amazing, the creepy voice-acting gives it that added sinister vibe and I actually really like the old-school style combat and difficulty - but when a game is so punishing that it starts wasting the players' time and causes resentment - well then I have to draw the line. So if it weren't for the 30fps nonsense, the unbalanced levelling up system and the scarcity of checkpoints (which really ended up being the deal-breaker for me) I would be fully on board with this  one. As it is, it is with a heavy heart that it has to be a thumbs down, an uninstall, and over to try Dragon's Dogma instead..\\n\\nFor my Top 10 triple A open-world fantasy RPGs, plus hundreds of reviews of indie games please follow or check out my website through my curator page at:\\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26108770-Parsons%27-Garden/]Parsons' Garden[/url]\",\n",

       " 'I knew very little about Dark Souls before going into it. I\\'ve heard people say that it was hard but amazing.\\n\\nWell, it is hard, that\\'s true, but unfortunately it\\'s not an amazing game. Not even close. If Steam allowed for it, I\\'d maybe give it a sideways thumb because I found it to be very \"meh\" overall. But for all the frustrating spots I encountered, I ultimately decided to give it a thumbs down. Yes, I got all the Steam achievements, but more because the game made it personal at some point and I wanted to beat it for good, not because I overly enjoyed it.\\n\\n\\nHere is a short list of the biggest cons I\\'ve found in 2 and a half playthroughs:\\n\\n- The difficulty is very uneven. Truth be told, most of the game is not overly hard because there are many ways to make it easier for yourself (f. e. by just grinding levels). But there are a few segments that will make you pull your hair out in frustration. You can tell that some portions were designed specifically to troll the player (f. e. that section in Anor Londo with the two archers). \\n\\n- Boss difficulty is also very uneven. I had surprisingly little trouble with most of the bosses, I even killed some on my first try. But once again, there are two huge difficulty spikes: First, there are Smough and Ornstein. Unless you\\'re some kind of Dark Souls god, the fight is mostly about luck, especially the first phase. You\\'ll just scramble for cover, trying to get some hits in and pray you don\\'t get comboed to death with little warning. The second offender is the final fight of the game against Gwyn, which I found doable on the first playthrough but way, WAY hard on subsequent playthroughs. Luckily, the Dark Souls programmers are incompetent, so you can just parry him over and over for an easy win with the right shield. To make it even easier, you can use your Estus Flask at certain points to force him to use his slowest attack which you can then parry with little difficulty. Rinse and repeat for an easy win. Look it up on Youtube, it\\'s hilarious. \\n\\n- Speaking of incompetent programmers: At some points in the game,  your character will get stuck in the floor. This of course always happens on narrow slopes (two I can think of specifically), where you least want it to happen. You can get past this with some patience, but come on. Did nobody playtest this?\\n\\n- The lore is not well presented. You\\'ll not learn much about the story or the NPCs unless you go look the information up yourself. The game certainly isn\\'t going to tell you enough to make you care. In fact, there\\'s little reason for not killing any and all NPCs you meet after you don\\'t need them anymore. The game didn\\'t make me care about them and they do drop nice loot, so I found little reason not to kill them all at some point.\\n\\n- The sidequests are horrible. In fact, I wouldn\\'t even attempt these without a guide because it\\'s so unclear how to get them to progress or where the corresponding NPCs will be at next. (Worst offenders: Big Hat Logan, Siegmeyer).\\n\\n- I\\'m normally not one to notice this, but I\\'m sure the game doesn\\'t run at 60 fps. In the fight against Seath, there are very noticeable fps drops. Once again, did no one playtest this?\\n\\n\\nDespite all this, the game has some good points. As noted, most of the levels present a fair challenge and the graphics are pretty decent even with the fps lock. However, because of the points above I couldn\\'t really enjoy my time with the game. In my opinion, it needed some more playtesting and balancing to make it truly amazing. As it is, it\\'s a mediocre RPG with some unwarranted difficulty spikes and lacking lore. Yes, I finished the game 100% but I can\\'t really say it was time well spent. I could\\'ve played through 5 better games in the 82.5h I invested into Dark Souls. Needless to say, I\\'ll never play this game again and I\\'ll also not bother with Dark Souls 2 or 3.\\n\\nRating: 5.5/10',\n",

Rinse and repeat countless hours dying and re-fighting waves of enemies discovering how to finish off the next type of enemy until you're left with what? It's repetitive, boring, tedious, and quite honestly, rather unimaginative gameplay that oftentimes leaves one with a sour taste in their mouth wondering why they continue to put time into the game. The storyline is also almost non-existent and unoriginal, with little that captivates the imagination short of quirky characters with somewhat humorous dialogue, sparsely placed in seemingly random locations around the world. I haven't played the second and third games, but after 60+ hours in the PS3 version of this game, I can highly recommend avoiding it if you don't want your gaming sessions to feel like a chore, with the enjoyment of completing something amounting to ~5% of your entire playthrough.\",\n",

Sure, that boss did telegraph its attacks through the whatever, but without knowing that, you're screwed.

I\\'m writing this review in light of the new REMASTERED edition, which doesn\\'t change enough about the game to make it worth money, and in many ways makes the game worse. The base game I recommend, but the remaster is a cash grab. \\n\\nDark Souls is misrepresented in a lot of ways, especially in those which relate to difficulty. In PvE, lots of players will complain about how hard the game seems, while others will praise the difficulty and slander anyone who complains. However, neither of these perspectives are particularly educated ones. The game itself is really just not that difficult. You can summon all help you could ever need, and even if you\\'d rather not, there\\'re still plenty of other ways to make most bosses easy. For example, The Four Kings can be beaten just by equipping Havel\\'s armor and using a strong weapon: once you\\'ve got enough armor to not flinch from their attacks, all you have to do is outdamage them and chug healing items. Dodging isn\\'t even necessary. Just walk up to them, smack them with any upgraded weapon, and then keep smacking them until you need to heal, then repeat. Even with a level 1 character it\\'s a pretty easy thing to do; it doesn\\'t require \"getting good\" or anything like that and anyone who says otherwise either has too much fear, too much pride, or not enough experience. Of course, it can be pretty hard if you aren\\'t aware of all the ways to water down the difficulty, but luckily the unfortunate vagueness of Dark Souls tends to hide just how exploitable its mechanics are, which luckily tends keep the game fun and interesting.\\n\\nUnfortunately Dark Souls’s vagueness and exploitability can stack together just as easily as they cancel out. Take chain-backstabbing in PvP for example; after backstabbing someone onto the ground, you can stand behind them, parry, and then backstab them again right as they get up if they don\\'t know how to counter it. New players will have no idea what the counter to this is or why people are throwing out odd parries, which results in a lot of people getting locked into infinite backstab chains. Comically, the solution is just to not push any buttons; this causes your character to turn around as they stand up and grants some brief immunity to backstabs. However, there\\'s absolutely nothing in the game which teaches you this, and it\\'s completely counterintuitive. Sure, it’s still “fair” if you know how the game works, but it’s nonsense nonetheless and thematically jarring as well. The prediction involved in the more advanced chaining techniques can be fun, but invasions usually end after two or three stabs, so unless you’re fighting the same guy over and over again, you’re just making uneducated guesses and nothing more; there’s nothing intellectual about that. It’s generally just a dumb noobstomper mechanic that ought to be removed from the game. Guaranteed backstab immunity on wakeup would be enough.\\n\\nOf course, the \"remaster\" doesn’t do anything to address this, and to make matters worse it removes the good tech skills as well. One of the exploits that managed to hold the original game together was deadangling, which allowed you to attack sideways to pass through shields, but now it’s completely gone. The only good way to deal with shield turtles is black flame now, but that requires you to keep your left hand free, which hurts all of the twohand weapons which originally just used deadangles instead. Curved swords like the falchion are going to be terrible now: they can’t even kick shields, and without their twohanded deadangles, you’ll be forced to use their slow onehanded swings just to keep black flame ready. Deadangles were also used to avoid parries as well, so now big slow weapons like the Zweihander are going to be even easier to pick on and parry away than they were before. Slow strength builds in general are just going to be bad because they won’t have the dexterity required to speed up black flame, and they wouldn’t be getting a twohanded strength bonus when their left hand is out either. This just leaves us with dex weapons like the chaos blade or spears, which barely had deadangles to begin with, worked well in one hand, and were already considered the best weapons in the game by most players. Meanwhile, the claymore, the second best greatsword in the game, will essentially be receiving a nerf to its twohanded strong attack and running attack as well, whereas the moonlight greatsword, the best greatsword in the game, is going to suffer almost no penalty at all since it never had that attack to begin with, never had a strength bonus, and always just dealt magic damage through most shields anyways. Basically everything that didn\\'t need a nerf got one, and everything that was top tier got left alone.\\n\\nDark Souls 3 might not have had much deadangling either (it actually has a little), but it had lots of ways to compensate for this. Shields were made much less stable, and you could basically preform a front-facing backstab on anyone who let their guard get broken. In addition to that, big slow weapons were given unparriable swings, so they didn’t need deadangles anymore. The remaster doesn’t have any of these features though; left and right you can see substandard weapons getting hurt by this change while the best ones are left unaffected, and nothing is being done about it. Worse still, none of the common-sense improvements from the sequel games were incorporated into the remaster either. The left bumper and trigger buttons still both block while twohanding, unlike in Dark Souls 3 where the left trigger performed a unique attack; despite the fact that you can go back into the original Dark Souls and swap moves around just through glitches, the developers weren’t even able to give just one extra attack to each weapon. Crossbows weren’t fixed either; in 3, you could aim them, fire, and then reload later, but in 1 you can’t aim down the sights and the reload animation is just a forced part of the firing animation. Sure, the remaster has 60fps, but the base game had a mod out for that within HOURS of its release, for FREE, and yet somehow the remaster costs 20$ or more and didn\\'t come out for YEARS.\\n\\nThe only improvement the remaster has is the increased number of players you can have per session; that\\'s it. It’s not worth the money. It’s a cash grab. I\\'d love to recommend the original, but you can\\'t buy it off of steam anymore; unless you\\'re willing to pirate it, you\\'re pretty much f[b][/b]ucked. You wouldn’t get any online play with a pirated copy, but the PvP was a little shallow compared to most fighting games anyways, so you’d still be getting the good part of the game plus all of the really big PvE mods. Obviously I can’t advocate piracy, but it isn’t like the original game is being sold anymore, so it’s pretty hard to call it stealing. Don’t buy the remaster though, and don’t buy other upcoming Bamco games like Code Vein either; they’ll just revoke your product years later and try to sell you back a downgraded copy.',\n",

There is absolutely no music in this game unless you're in certain hubs or fighting bosses, which led me to playing my own audio a lot of the time which is fine, because most of the music isn't that special anyway. There were a couple of bosses that simply wouldn't let me beat them because they would spam attacks that prevented me from being able to attack them, which is a great sign of false difficulty. Speaking of that, I did have a hard time getting through the first few parts of this game, but it wasn't because I was bad at the game, it was because the game didn't tell me how to properly play the game. People can criticise that statement all they want, but I had a MUCH easier time getting through this game once I knew what weapons and armour I should use, and what points I should upgrade depending on my class layout, and I had to get all of that knowledge online instead of actually playing through the game. If it weren't for online, I'd probably still be playing the game right now with a mediocre character at best, which shouldn't happen (if you're a competent game). (Also, if you messed up like me, you'll have to do a lot of mandatory grinding in order to better your weapons and armour and character for future areas/bosses [if you want a reasonable experience] which is never fun.) And besides all of that, when I first bought this game it didn't work at all, and had to patch it myself, which I don't have that big of a problem with, but it was developled by a Triple A company, and still managed to remain unplayable after so long, of course they fixed that with the remaster now, so it isn't really a downside anymore, but you still have to pay $20 even if you bought the original which I won't go into now.\\n\\nI finished the entire game including the DLC just to make sure if I would like this game or not, and while I didn't enjoy it for the most part, I could see how other people would like this game and I wouldn't argue that. However I think there are other games out there that are more enjoyable to play for the same amount of money, which is a dissapointment given how much publicity this game was given for it's 'difficulty', and other things.\\n\\n(This is basically my immendiate thoughts after finishing this game, so I probably didn't go over everything I wanted to, which means I'll probably edit it later if I want.)\",\n",

People call it \"old school\", but it\\'s old school in the worst way, it\\'s bringing back bad design and mechanics we had forced on us from limited budgets and simple technological limits.

It hinges on its difficulty to push players forward. No one wants to back down from a challenge.

The first dark souls relies on cheap enemy placement and gimmicks to weave a frustrating experience.\\n\\nTake undead burg for example- one of the first areas of the game. You have skeletons with firebombs that lob them at a rate of one every 2 seconds- they CHUNK your health, and there are usually two or three of them grouped together- usually in a place you cant reach as you're having to fight off a handful of enemies at the same time.\\n\\nThen there are Archers at every turn that capitolize on the fact you're distracted fighting enemies to bombard you with shot after shot. You can dodge the arrow, but you'll still most likely be hit by the enemy in front of you unless you can time a back step or a roll perfectly to avoid both.\\n\\nThe first dark souls is also a bit of a clunky mess.

       " 'Game \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\nh A game that spawned a new genre h\\n\\nDark Souls the first game was and still is revolutionary for its time Its a game that pretty much became its own genre and even though many games have tried to copy and paste its mechanics none do it quite like the original game or Demon Souls on PS \\n\\nDark Souls is a game thats very difficult to start Immediately the game is very discouraging It throws you into its world it explains nothing it shows and teaches you almost nothing the odds are against you and it pretty much expects you to fail This is surprisingly a weird motivator that makes you keep playing the game You want to beat the odds you want to be the lowly nobody who will best the world and prove the game wrong The odds may be against you but you can still beat them you know its possible it will just be a hard journey\\n\\nh Careful panning taking it slowly and patience are your best weapons in Dark Souls h\\n\\nDark Souls is a third person action RPG more or less I say more or less because If you treat this game as all other action games you are going to have a bad time Dark Souls requires a certain state of mind to be played In most action games you can mow down low level enemies with little effort and only get serious when you get to boss fights Not in Dark Souls In Dark Souls every single enemy can kill you if you arent careful The very first enemy you encounter can kill you with only a few hits So what do you do You play this game carefully You plan you every attack you roll around you dodge and if you are feeling bold you parry You treat every single enemy as a threat and soon this becomes second nature to you \\n\\nh Your character can tire easily and you are expected to fight giant bosses h\\n\\nOne of the first things you will learn about Dark Souls is that you cant just spam an attack You cant do this because you have a stamina bar At first this seems like a really annoying thing and you know what it kind of is but this is also what gives this game its identity The stamina bar depletes fast but it also recharges fast too If you simply spam your attack you will become tired and your character will become vulnerable Dont you think that you can just endlessly dodge and hold your shield forever too because that else depletes your stamina The game encourages you to be careful but to also not get too comfortable with standing and using the same thing over and over again\\nWhile small enemies trash mobs are a threat the game wouldnt be as popular if it werent for its bosses The bosses in this game are big strong memorable and very intimidating The first time you play a game you will probably say something like OH MY GOD I HAVE TO FIGHT THAT THING with a shaky voice Once you beat a boss you will feel a sense of accomplishment unlike in any other game but you will die a lot\\n\\nh You died you will see this message a lot h\\n\\nDying is part of this game and actually a big part of the lore of Dark Souls Every enemy you kill will award you with souls Souls are basically your XP as well as your currency Everything in this game requires souls When you kill an enemy you get souls kill bigger enemies and you will get more souls Now when you gather a lot of souls you take them to a checkpoint bonfire and you spend them to level up your attributes You can also use them to upgrade your weapons buy equipment and consumables and for other various things \\n\\nBEWARE if you should die you will lose all your souls BUT WAIT its not all bad You will only lose the souls that you havent spent and once you respawn you can travel to the spot where you died are retrieve them This is a really great mechanic It encourages you to try again but also makes sure you dont rush back to the place where you die so you dont die on the way there If you die before retrieving your souls from the last place you died you will lose them for good \\nh The story is there but its entirely up to you how much of it you want to hear h\\n\\nSo I havent mentioned the story While there is indeed a story the game simply doesnt tell it to you Or at least doesnt tell it directly It gives you a brief explanation at the beginning and just throws you out there You have to piece together the story by exploring the world talking to characters fighting bosses and generally you will get the gist of what was going on If not you arent really missing much \\n\\nThe world of Dark Souls is amazing Its so carefully and lovingly tailored The entire world is basically an abandoned kingdom populated by undead minions and beasts Going from checkpoint to checkpoint can require quite a few attempts and once you reach it you might even throw a little celebration For me the absolute best feeling I ever got from playing Dark Souls was when I found a shortcut As you explore the world you will find ladders elevators bridges locked doors More often than not once you open them you will get a shortcut that will cut that  minute trip to a  minute climb Finding shortcuts makes me happier than it should\\n\\nh You arent alone h\\n\\nI havent even mentioned the online While you dont have to play the game online at all you will be missing out on what makes Dark Souls special Dark souls has this thing called humanity If you consume a humanity you turn into a human This makes it easier for you to find rare items and material easier BUT it also puts a target on your head Other players who are also playing their game can invade your game in an attempt to kill you So if you plan on using humanity make sure you are prepared for a fight against an overpowered invader  \\n\\nTruly Dark Souls is a masterpiece My review cannot do justice to how great this game and SERIES is\\n\\nh BUT BUT BUT h\\n\\nNot this version Definitely not this version This PC version of the original Dark Souls is the laziest console port in existence You know how many PC games recommend you use a controller well not only does this version recommend it it spits in your face if you want to use a mouse and keyboard It doesnt even show you the keyboard keys but the layout of an Xbox  controller I cant even begin to describe how insulting this is I like my Xbox  controller and I will gladly use it with this game but not everyone who owns a PC wants that The game is locked at  frames per second and you will be lucky if you can even get that to run smoothly The online community is full of hackers that cant be damaged and the graphics look like crap Overall its almost unplayable \\n\\nh I shouldnt have to patch a game in order to make it playable h\\n\\nYES you can patch the game up with lots of patches and make it a bit more playable but thats not a good excuse to buy this game IN FACT you cant even buy this game anymore This version isnt available anymore only the remastered version Im not sure if the remastered version is better than this one\\n\\nSo if nobody can even buy this game anymore why did I bother even writing this review Because I adore this game and I feel it deserves a review If you want to play Dark Souls get the remastered version or the console versions of this game Just play it but not this one at least not if you arent keen on installing a thousand patches\\n\\nNext game The Darkness \\nhttpssteamcommunitycomprofilesrecommended\\n\\nhIf you liked my review

Yet here Im to shed some light on older games for anyone wishing to jump in late\\n\\n\\nFirst of all interface and controls are just terrible even playing with xbox controller Movement not always registers like jumping attack and combat is just as much fighting your enemy as it is fighting your camera It is clunky character movements are imprecise and hitboxes are always iffy I had found out that major cause of death in this game by far are bad controls and bad game engine Sometimes enemies will auto land hit on you while performing jumping attack They literally change their direction in the air to hit you while game arbitrary decide if your jump attack hits opponent or you just land awkwardly in the middle of the enemy pack Then there is constant battling with camera and constantly making a wrong move I swing heavy instead of jumping It leaves open to counter attack and half of my hp is gone Clumsy movement prevents me from positioning myself properly and I miss a hit Not to mention that enemy can insta kill due to animation glitches where I died during the jump on the enemy There was no animation from him which would count but game had decided that I was hit I find this game highly frustrating to play as the main source of challenge is dealing with quite frankly bad game Consumables are nonrechargable through saves but game insta kills you with no fair chance to prepare for further encounters Game lags during certain moments NPC have iffy AI who on rare occasions can aggro you while they should not I have such experience with this game and it is just frustrating to get to where you actually need over such nonsense Then there are weird bugs Every reload game starts to lag as FPS drop severely \\n\\nThen there is combat I guess this is part of the charm to people To keep trying and trying over again Yet I do not see enjoyment the same way Difficulty spikes in this game are through the roof You are fighting  minutes mobs only to get  chance at the boss which  shots you There are no clues no advise nothing to help you with it Boss appears BAM instant death Then repeat for several hours boss grind before you get a routine and at that point bosses become trivial too In this sense this game is amongst the easier ones as it is not demanding in terms of technical skill or game being difficult all the time No game is merely unreasonable and kills you outright Then you learn how to dance and you overcome challenge quite easily I never considered this kind of gaming to be enjoyable to me but rather a method of abusing game mechanics which gives me very little pleasure Dark Souls seem to be built around that gamey mechanic of abusing mobs and learning the game through trial and error It also artificially stretches game time immensely as you must repeat lengthy portions of the game before you get chance to face boss itself which is just tedious and grindy I personally cannot stand such grind and I strongly believe that before and after every boss there should be bonefires Now if I die I have to repeat huge portion of a game just to get one chance at experiencing that those unique mobs are like I tried to go under the bridge yet no bonefire just some metal boar there I had died to simple skeleton because my hit went god knows where and it just went beserk with rapid succession of hits\\n\\n\\nIn the end I quit from frustration I had found combat rather trivial as mobs could be dispatched with heavy attack quite easily Bosses are gimmicky from few which I saw and quite easy when you know what to do youtube is essential but at the same time it makes this game pointless \\n\\nFor example you are on a narrow bridge and your whole view is taken by boss back I cannot see anything at all Even if you know that to do a lot of it is down to chance Boss randomly blocks your path Sometimes plunging attack doesnt work and your are dropped off the map Game is damn buggy like that I heard that boss itself can rather just fall off the edge After beating said boss I proceeded further Game had no check point after a boss Furthermore it gave no warning about the dragon too Not only that it had level design where I could accidentally mistaken old bonefire with new and restart my whole progress After that dragon got bugged and it simply wont ignite the ground I had to suicide myself just for him to do anything at all\\n\\n\\nNow game is also abysmal at explaining you things Interface could not be worse Not only it is clumsy to navigate through but also it is full of stats which game does not explain at all \\n\\n\\nThese are faults within game It is not like game is bad I certainly can see how people thirsty of such games at the time allowed Dark Souls to explode Yet I do not think that it really holds up to the modern standard People here are promoting this game because of nostalgia and due to their familiarity of the game They already know everything and how game works So for them it is fine For completely new player I would hesitate to recommend this product It requires certain kind of person to enjoy it Long checkpoint trivial combat designed to force grindy attempts against a boss I would bet that sequel or Dark Souls  like games already innovated and improved on the concept as a whole and said game is rather for veterans Unless of course unfair and grindy gameplay is attractive to you A lot of people find enjoyment of spending a lot of time and effort in trying to learn sequence in how to engage mobs as engaging For me learning that this big boss can be defeated by BBRB sequence is little fun',\n",

and in many ways makes the game worse The base game I recommend but the remaster is a cash grab \\n\\nDark Souls is misrepresented in a lot of ways especially in those which relate to difficulty In PvE lots of players will complain about how hard the game seems while others will praise the difficulty and slander anyone who complains However neither of these perspectives are particularly educated ones The game itself is really just not that difficult You can summon all help you could ever need and even if youd rather not therere still plenty of other ways to make most bosses easy For example The Four Kings can be beaten just by equipping Havels armor and using a strong weapon once youve got enough armor to not flinch from their attacks all you have to do is outdamage them and chug healing items Dodging isnt even necessary Just walk up to them smack them with any upgraded weapon and then keep smacking them until you need to heal then repeat Even with a level  character its a pretty easy thing to do it doesnt require getting good or anything like that and anyone who says otherwise either has too much fear too much pride or not enough experience Of course it can be pretty hard if you arent aware of all the ways to water down the difficulty but luckily the unfortunate vagueness of Dark Souls tends to hide just how exploitable its mechanics are which luckily tends keep the game fun and interesting\\n\\nUnfortunately Dark Soulss vagueness and exploitability can stack together just as easily as they cancel out Take chainbackstabbing in PvP for example after backstabbing someone onto the ground you can stand behind them parry and then backstab them again right as they get up if they dont know how to counter it New players will have no idea what the counter to this is or why people are throwing out odd parries which results in a lot of people getting locked into infinite backstab chains Comically the solution is just to not push any buttons this causes your character to turn around as they stand up and grants some brief immunity to backstabs However theres absolutely nothing in the game which teaches you this and its completely counterintuitive Sure its still fair if you know how the game works but its nonsense nonetheless and thematically jarring as well The prediction involved in the more advanced chaining techniques can be fun but invasions usually end after two or three stabs so unless youre fighting the same guy over and over again youre just making uneducated guesses and nothing more theres nothing intellectual about that Its generally just a dumb noobstomper mechanic that ought to be removed from the game Guaranteed backstab immunity on wakeup would be enough\\n\\nOf course the remaster doesnt do anything to address this and to make matters worse it removes the good tech skills as well One of the exploits that managed to hold the original game together was deadangling which allowed you to attack sideways to pass through shields but now its completely gone The only good way to deal with shield turtles is black flame now but that requires you to keep your left hand free which hurts all of the twohand weapons which originally just used deadangles instead Curved swords like the falchion are going to be terrible now they cant even kick shields and without their twohanded deadangles youll be forced to use their slow onehanded swings just to keep black flame ready Deadangles were also used to avoid parries as well so now big slow weapons like the Zweihander are going to be even easier to pick on and parry away than they were before Slow strength builds in general are just going to be bad because they wont have the dexterity required to speed up black flame and they wouldnt be getting a twohanded strength bonus when their left hand is out either This just leaves us with dex weapons like the chaos blade or spears which barely had deadangles to begin with worked well in one hand and were already considered the best weapons in the game by most players Meanwhile the claymore the second best greatsword in the game will essentially be receiving a nerf to its twohanded strong attack and running attack as well whereas the moonlight greatsword the best greatsword in the game is going to suffer almost no penalty at all since it never had that attack to begin with never had a strength bonus and always just dealt magic damage through most shields anyways Basically everything that didnt need a nerf got one and everything that was top tier got left alone\\n\\nDark Souls  might not have had much deadangling either it actually has a little but it had lots of ways to compensate for this Shields were made much less stable and you could basically preform a frontfacing backstab on anyone who let their guard get broken In addition to that big slow weapons were given unparriable swings so they didnt need deadangles anymore The remaster doesnt have any of these features though left and right you can see substandard weapons getting hurt by this change while the best ones are left unaffected and nothing is being done about it Worse still none of the commonsense improvements from the sequel games were incorporated into the remaster either The left bumper and trigger buttons still both block while twohanding unlike in Dark Souls  where the left trigger performed a unique attack despite the fact that you can go back into the original Dark Souls and swap moves around just through glitches the developers werent even able to give just one extra attack to each weapon Crossbows werent fixed either in  you could aim them fire and then reload later but in  you cant aim down the sights and the reload animation is just a forced part of the firing animation Sure the remaster has fps but the base game had a mod out for that within HOURS of its release for FREE and yet somehow the remaster costs  or more and didnt come out for YEARS\\n\\nThe only improvement the remaster has is the increased number of players you can have per session thats it Its not worth the money Its a cash grab Id love to recommend the original but you cant buy it off of steam anymore unless youre willing to pirate it youre pretty much fbbucked You wouldnt get any online play with a pirated copy but the PvP was a little shallow compared to most fighting games anyways so youd still be getting the good part of the game plus all of the really big PvE mods Obviously I cant advocate piracy but it isnt like the original game is being sold anymore so its pretty hard to call it stealing Dont buy the remaster though and dont buy other upcoming Bamco games like Code Vein either theyll just revoke your product years later and try to sell you back a downgraded copy',\n",

own genre and even though many games have tried to copy and paste its mechanics none do it quite like the original game or demon souls on ps \\n\\ndark souls is a game thats very difficult to start immediately the game is very discouraging it throws you into its world it explains nothing it shows and teaches you almost nothing the odds are against you and it pretty much expects you to fail this is surprisingly a weird motivator that makes you keep playing the game you want to beat the odds you want to be the lowly nobody who will best the world and prove the game wrong the odds may be against you but you can still beat them you know its possible it will just be a hard journey\\n\\nh careful panning taking it slowly and patience are your best weapons in dark souls h\\n\\ndark souls is a third person action rpg more or less i say more or less because if you treat this game as all other action games you are going to have a bad time dark souls requires a certain state of mind to be played in most action games you can mow down low level enemies with little effort and only get serious when you get to boss fights not in dark souls in dark souls every single enemy can kill you if you arent careful the very first enemy you encounter can kill you with only a few hits so what do you do you play this game carefully you plan you every attack you roll around you dodge and if you are feeling bold you parry you treat every single enemy as a threat and soon this becomes second nature to you \\n\\nh your character can tire easily and you are expected to fight giant bosses h\\n\\none of the first things you will learn about dark souls is that you cant just spam an attack you cant do this because you have a stamina bar at first this seems like a really annoying thing and you know what it kind of is but this is also what gives this game its identity the stamina bar depletes fast but it also recharges fast too if you simply spam your attack you will become tired and your character will become vulnerable dont you think that you can just endlessly dodge and hold your shield forever too because that else depletes your stamina the game encourages you to be careful but to also not get too comfortable with standing and using the same thing over and over again\\nwhile small enemies trash mobs are a threat the game wouldnt be as popular if it werent for its bosses the bosses in this game are big strong memorable and very intimidating the first time you play a game you will probably say something like oh my god i have to fight that thing with a shaky voice once you beat a boss you will feel a sense of accomplishment unlike in any other game but you will die a lot\\n\\nh you died you will see this message a lot h\\n\\ndying is part of this game and actually a big part of the lore of dark souls every enemy you kill will award you with souls souls are basically your xp as well as your currency everything in this game requires souls when you kill an enemy you get souls kill bigger enemies and you will get more souls now when you gather a lot of souls you take them to a checkpoint bonfire and you spend them to level up your attributes you can also use them to upgrade your weapons buy equipment and consumables and for other various things \\n\\nbeware if you should die you will lose all your souls but wait its not all bad you will only lose the souls that you havent spent and once you respawn you can travel to the spot where you died are retrieve them this is a really great mechanic it encourages you to try again but also makes sure you dont rush back to the place where you die so you dont die on the way there if you die before retrieving your souls from the last place you died you will lose them for good \\nh the story is there but its entirely up to you how much of it you want to hear h\\n\\nso i havent mentioned the story while there is indeed a story the game simply doesnt tell it to you or at least doesnt tell it directly it gives you a brief explanation at the beginning and just throws you out there you have to piece together the story by exploring the world talking to characters fighting bosses and generally you will get the gist of what was going on if not you arent really missing much \\n\\nthe world of dark souls is amazing its so carefully and lovingly tailored the entire world is basically an abandoned kingdom populated by undead minions and beasts going from checkpoint to checkpoint can require quite a few attempts and once you reach it you might even throw a little celebration for me the absolute best feeling i ever got from playing dark souls was when i found a shortcut as you explore the world you will find ladders elevators bridges locked doors more often than not once you open them you will get a shortcut that will cut that  minute trip to a  minute climb finding shortcuts makes me happier than it should\\n\\nh you arent alone h\\n\\ni havent even mentioned the online while you dont have to play the game online at all you will be missing out on what makes dark souls special dark souls has this thing called humanity if you consume a humanity you turn into a human this makes it easier for you to find rare items and material easier but it also puts a target on your head other players who are also playing their game can invade your game in an attempt to kill you so if you plan on using humanity make sure you are prepared for a fight against an overpowered invader  \\n\\ntruly dark souls is a masterpiece my review cannot do justice to how great this game and series is\\n\\nh but but but h\\n\\nnot this version definitely not this version this pc version of the original dark souls is the laziest console port in existence you know how many pc games recommend you use a controller well not only does this version recommend it it spits in your face if you want to use a mouse and keyboard it doesnt even show you the keyboard keys but the layout of an xbox  controller i cant even begin to describe how insulting this is i like my xbox  controller and i will gladly use it with this game but not everyone who owns a pc wants that the game is locked at  frames per second and you will be lucky if you can even get that to run smoothly the online community is full of hackers that cant be damaged and the graphics look like crap overall its almost unplayable \\n\\nh i shouldnt have to patch a game in order to make it playable h\\n\\nyes you can patch the game up with lots of patches and make it a bit more playable but thats not a good excuse to buy this game in fact you cant even buy this game anymore this version isnt available anymore only the remastered version im not sure if the remastered version is better than this one\\n\\nso if nobody can even buy this game anymore why did i bother even writing this review because i adore this game and i feel it deserves a review if you want to play dark souls get the remastered version or the console versions of this game just play it but not this one at least not if you arent keen on installing a thousand patches\\n\\nnext game the darkness \\nhttpssteamcommunitycomprofilesrecommended\\n\\nhif you liked my review

yet here im to shed some light on older games for anyone wishing to jump in late\\n\\n\\nfirst of all interface and controls are just terrible even playing with xbox controller movement not always registers like jumping attack and combat is just as much fighting your enemy as it is fighting your camera it is clunky character movements are imprecise and hitboxes are always iffy i had found out that major cause of death in this game by far are bad controls and bad game engine sometimes enemies will auto land hit on you while performing jumping attack they literally change their direction in the air to hit you while game arbitrary decide if your jump attack hits opponent or you just land awkwardly in the middle of the enemy pack then there is constant battling with camera and constantly making a wrong move i swing heavy instead of jumping it leaves open to counter attack and half of my hp is gone clumsy movement prevents me from positioning myself properly and i miss a hit not to mention that enemy can insta kill due to animation glitches where i died during the jump on the enemy there was no animation from him which would count but game had decided that i was hit i find this game highly frustrating to play as the main source of challenge is dealing with quite frankly bad game consumables are nonrechargable through saves but game insta kills you with no fair chance to prepare for further encounters game lags during certain moments npc have iffy ai who on rare occasions can aggro you while they should not i have such experience with this game and it is just frustrating to get to where you actually need over such nonsense then there are weird bugs every reload game starts to lag as fps drop severely \\n\\nthen there is combat i guess this is part of the charm to people to keep trying and trying over again yet i do not see enjoyment the same way difficulty spikes in this game are through the roof you are fighting  minutes mobs only to get  chance at the boss which  shots you there are no clues no advise nothing to help you with it boss appears bam instant death then repeat for several hours boss grind before you get a routine and at that point bosses become trivial too in this sense this game is amongst the easier ones as it is not demanding in terms of technical skill or game being difficult all the time no game is merely unreasonable and kills you outright then you learn how to dance and you overcome challenge quite easily i never considered this kind of gaming to be enjoyable to me but rather a method of abusing game mechanics which gives me very little pleasure dark souls seem to be built around that gamey mechanic of abusing mobs and learning the game through trial and error it also artificially stretches game time immensely as you must repeat lengthy portions of the game before you get chance to face boss itself which is just tedious and grindy i personally cannot stand such grind and i strongly believe that before and after every boss there should be bonefires now if i die i have to repeat huge portion of a game just to get one chance at experiencing that those unique mobs are like i tried to go under the bridge yet no bonefire just some metal boar there i had died to simple skeleton because my hit went god knows where and it just went beserk with rapid succession of hits\\n\\n\\nin the end i quit from frustration i had found combat rather trivial as mobs could be dispatched with heavy attack quite easily bosses are gimmicky from few which i saw and quite easy when you know what to do youtube is essential but at the same time it makes this game pointless \\n\\nfor example you are on a narrow bridge and your whole view is taken by boss back i cannot see anything at all even if you know that to do a lot of it is down to chance boss randomly blocks your path sometimes plunging attack doesnt work and your are dropped off the map game is damn buggy like that i heard that boss itself can rather just fall off the edge after beating said boss i proceeded further game had no check point after a boss furthermore it gave no warning about the dragon too not only that it had level design where i could accidentally mistaken old bonefire with new and restart my whole progress after that dragon got bugged and it simply wont ignite the ground i had to suicide myself just for him to do anything at all\\n\\n\\nnow game is also abysmal at explaining you things interface could not be worse not only it is clumsy to navigate through but also it is full of stats which game does not explain at all \\n\\n\\nthese are faults within game it is not like game is bad i certainly can see how people thirsty of such games at the time allowed dark souls to explode yet i do not think that it really holds up to the modern standard people here are promoting this game because of nostalgia and due to their familiarity of the game they already know everything and how game works so for them it is fine for completely new player i would hesitate to recommend this product it requires certain kind of person to enjoy it long checkpoint trivial combat designed to force grindy attempts against a boss i would bet that sequel or dark souls  like games already innovated and improved on the concept as a whole and said game is rather for veterans unless of course unfair and grindy gameplay is attractive to you a lot of people find enjoyment of spending a lot of time and effort in trying to learn sequence in how to engage mobs as engaging for me learning that this big boss can be defeated by bbrb sequence is little fun',\n",

and in many ways makes the game worse the base game i recommend but the remaster is a cash grab \\n\\ndark souls is misrepresented in a lot of ways especially in those which relate to difficulty in pve lots of players will complain about how hard the game seems while others will praise the difficulty and slander anyone who complains however neither of these perspectives are particularly educated ones the game itself is really just not that difficult you can summon all help you could ever need and even if youd rather not therere still plenty of other ways to make most bosses easy for example the four kings can be beaten just by equipping havels armor and using a strong weapon once youve got enough armor to not flinch from their attacks all you have to do is outdamage them and chug healing items dodging isnt even necessary just walk up to them smack them with any upgraded weapon and then keep smacking them until you need to heal then repeat even with a level  character its a pretty easy thing to do it doesnt require getting good or anything like that and anyone who says otherwise either has too much fear too much pride or not enough experience of course it can be pretty hard if you arent aware of all the ways to water down the difficulty but luckily the unfortunate vagueness of dark souls tends to hide just how exploitable its mechanics are which luckily tends keep the game fun and interesting\\n\\nunfortunately dark soulss vagueness and exploitability can stack together just as easily as they cancel out take chainbackstabbing in pvp for example after backstabbing someone onto the ground you can stand behind them parry and then backstab them again right as they get up if they dont know how to counter it new players will have no idea what the counter to this is or why people are throwing out odd parries which results in a lot of people getting locked into infinite backstab chains comically the solution is just to not push any buttons this causes your character to turn around as they stand up and grants some brief immunity to backstabs however theres absolutely nothing in the game which teaches you this and its completely counterintuitive sure its still fair if you know how the game works but its nonsense nonetheless and thematically jarring as well the prediction involved in the more advanced chaining techniques can be fun but invasions usually end after two or three stabs so unless youre fighting the same guy over and over again youre just making uneducated guesses and nothing more theres nothing intellectual about that its generally just a dumb noobstomper mechanic that ought to be removed from the game guaranteed backstab immunity on wakeup would be enough\\n\\nof course the remaster doesnt do anything to address this and to make matters worse it removes the good tech skills as well one of the exploits that managed to hold the original game together was deadangling which allowed you to attack sideways to pass through shields but now its completely gone the only good way to deal with shield turtles is black flame now but that requires you to keep your left hand free which hurts all of the twohand weapons which originally just used deadangles instead curved swords like the falchion are going to be terrible now they cant even kick shields and without their twohanded deadangles youll be forced to use their slow onehanded swings just to keep black flame ready deadangles were also used to avoid parries as well so now big slow weapons like the zweihander are going to be even easier to pick on and parry away than they were before slow strength builds in general are just going to be bad because they wont have the dexterity required to speed up black flame and they wouldnt be getting a twohanded strength bonus when their left hand is out either this just leaves us with dex weapons like the chaos blade or spears which barely had deadangles to begin with worked well in one hand and were already considered the best weapons in the game by most players meanwhile the claymore the second best greatsword in the game will essentially be receiving a nerf to its twohanded strong attack and running attack as well whereas the moonlight greatsword the best greatsword in the game is going to suffer almost no penalty at all since it never had that attack to begin with never had a strength bonus and always just dealt magic damage through most shields anyways basically everything that didnt need a nerf got one and everything that was top tier got left alone\\n\\ndark souls  might not have had much deadangling either it actually has a little but it had lots of ways to compensate for this shields were made much less stable and you could basically preform a frontfacing backstab on anyone who let their guard get broken in addition to that big slow weapons were given unparriable swings so they didnt need deadangles anymore the remaster doesnt have any of these features though left and right you can see substandard weapons getting hurt by this change while the best ones are left unaffected and nothing is being done about it worse still none of the commonsense improvements from the sequel games were incorporated into the remaster either the left bumper and trigger buttons still both block while twohanding unlike in dark souls  where the left trigger performed a unique attack despite the fact that you can go back into the original dark souls and swap moves around just through glitches the developers werent even able to give just one extra attack to each weapon crossbows werent fixed either in  you could aim them fire and then reload later but in  you cant aim down the sights and the reload animation is just a forced part of the firing animation sure the remaster has fps but the base game had a mod out for that within hours of its release for free and yet somehow the remaster costs  or more and didnt come out for years\\n\\nthe only improvement the remaster has is the increased number of players you can have per session thats it its not worth the money its a cash grab id love to recommend the original but you cant buy it off of steam anymore unless youre willing to pirate it youre pretty much fbbucked you wouldnt get any online play with a pirated copy but the pvp was a little shallow compared to most fighting games anyways so youd still be getting the good part of the game plus all of the really big pve mods obviously i cant advocate piracy but it isnt like the original game is being sold anymore so its pretty hard to call it stealing dont buy the remaster though and dont buy other upcoming bamco games like code vein either theyll just revoke your product years later and try to sell you back a downgraded copy',\n",
